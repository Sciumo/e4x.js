jQuery E4X DOM Plugin
=====================

*Version 0.1.1*

The jQuery E4X DOM Plugin (jquery.e4x-dom.js) adds support for XML objects as DOM nodes
in jQuery. It also adds support for converting jQuery objects into XMLLists and sets
the default XML namespace to `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` so you don't have to
yourself when dealing with (X)HTML. To reset/change the default namespace, just use the
following in the scope you wish for the namespace to be changed in.

    default xml namespace = "";
