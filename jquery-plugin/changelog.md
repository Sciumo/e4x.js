0.1.4
=====

* Minor speed and minification optimizations.
* The last version was errantly called 0.1.4 in the source code instead of 0.1.4. This is
  the real 0.1.4.


0.1.3
=====

* Moved strict mode declaration to the top of the script.
* No longer changing the global default XML namespace. If an XML element does not have a
  namespace, it is assigned the XHTML 1.x namespace. To change the default assigned
  namespace, change `jQuery.defaultXMLNamespace` accordingly.


0.1.2
=====

* Added support for using XML as the context in `jQuery.fn.init()` calls.


0.1.1
=====

* Optimizations.


0.1
===

* Initial release.
